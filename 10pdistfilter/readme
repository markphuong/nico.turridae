sbatch pdistbatch

calculate cutoffs by finding the 95 percentile of all possible pairwise comparisons

you do this by comparing pdistances between all possible pairwise comparisons in every fastafile

sbatch pdistfilterbatch

for every species comparison where the comparison is greater than the 95th
percentile cutoff, add 1 to a dictionary where the species have separate keys.

if a species has been flaged in > 10% of the comparisons, remove that species

if >20% of the species are removed, remove the entire alignment

creates 'entire_locus_removed' which lists the loci that failed this filter

this filter likely catches poorly aligned alignments

in results, you have:

1. the original file '.NI'
2. the '.pdist' file which contains sequences that passed thisfilter
3. the 'pdistremoved' file which contains the sequences that were removed
