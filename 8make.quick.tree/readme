sbatch tree_batch

used this to only choose loci that had at least 2 species in it.

copied those files into /results, which were used in the downstream steps

sbatch treebatchraxml

also made a guide tree to help me figure out which speices to pick

ran it in raxml

resultant file: RAxML_bipartitions.turrid.test

used all alignments with at least 19 speices in it

only included the 5 SRR sequences + the 22 transcriptomes paul sent me
